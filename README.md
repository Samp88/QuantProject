# QuantProject
A HFT Quant analysis project

To run the project, you need go to __strategy_runner.py__ and run bash command __python strategy_runner.py__.
You also need to check if you have all data needed.

```
1. snapshot data in data/
2. calendar.csv in help_data/
3. ContractList.csv in help_data/
```

You can change the model paramters by editing __help_data/strategy_config.json__ where some parameters are defined.
